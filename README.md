# Structured-Document-Processing

---------- Part 1 ----------
Document Types

DTD document and XML Schema, together with some documents of instances generated from the types.

The type of document for a collection of recipes must be defined in both DTD and XSD, making in each case the best possible use of the expressive ability of the respective language. Some instance documents produced with each of the definitions must be delivered, illustrating all kinds of elements and attributes defined.

---------- Part 2 ----------

Stylesheets CSS and XSL
XHTML transformations

The purpose of this paper is to transform the collection-type documents previously defined with DTD and XSD. If necessary, changes can be made to these definitions in order to correct deficiencies or to facilitate the transformation process. This transformation has the dual objective of:

- Provide a preview of the recipes collection;
- Supplement the validation of the revenue collection.

---------- Part 3 ----------

Document Semantics
RDF Metadata with modulation of dominion in RDF Schema.

The third practical work has the objective of creating metadata related to collections of recipes developed in previous works. The production of RDF-XML documents with the metadata must use an XSLT transformation on the respective XML document containing the collection of recipes.


Each of this Parts objectives will be explained in more detail in the associated Readme_PartX
